          The stance detection task aims at detecting the stance of a tweet or a text for a target. These targets can be named entities or free-form sentences (claims). Though the task involves reasoning of the tweet with respect to a target, we find that it is possible to achieve high accuracy on several publicly available Twitter stance detection datasets without looking at the target sentence. Specifically, a simple tweet classification model achieved human-level performance on the WTâ€“WT dataset and more than two-third accuracy on various other datasets. We investigate the existence of biases in such datasets to find the potential spurious correlations of sentiment-stance relations and lexcal choice associated with the stance category. Furthermore, we propose a new large dataset free of such biases and demonstrate its aptness on the existing stance detection systems. Our empirical findings show much scope for research on the stance detection task and proposes several considerations for creating future stance detection datasets.

        <div id="covid" class="collapse" style="font-size:15px;margin:50px">Twitter has acted as an important source of information during disasters and pandemic, especially during the times of COVID-19. In this paper, we describe our system entry for <i>WNUT 2020 Shared Task-3</i>. The task was aimed at automating the extraction of a variety of COVID-19 related events from Twitter, such as individuals who recently contracted the virus, someone with symptoms who were denied testing and believed remedies against the infection. The system consists of separate multi-task models for slot-filling subtasks and sentence-classification subtasks while leveraging the useful sentence-level information for the corresponding event. The system uses COVID-Twitter-Bert with attention-weighted pooling of candidate slot-chunk features to capture the useful information chunks. The system ranks <b>1st at the leader-board</b> with F1 of 0.6598, without using any ensembles or additional datasets. <br> <br>

        <div id="semeval21" class="collapse" style="font-size:15px;margin:50px">SemEval-2021 Task 8: MeasEval aims at improving the machine understanding of measurements in scientific texts through a set of entity and semantic relation extraction sub-tasks on identifying quantity spans along with various attributes and relationships. This paper describes our system, consisting of a three-stage pipeline, that leverages pre-trained language models to extract the quantity spans in the text, followed by intelligent templates to identify units and modifiers. Finally, it identifies the quantity attributes and their relations using language models boosted with a feature re-using hierarchical architecture and multi-task learning. Our submission significantly outperforms the baseline, with the best model from the post-evaluation phase delivering more than 100% increase on F1 (Overall) from the baseline. <br> <br>

            Supervised models trained to predict properties from representations, have been achieving high accuracy on a variety of tasks. For instance, the BERT family seems to work exceptionally well on the downstream task from NER tagging to the range of other linguistic tasks. But the vocabulary used in the medical field contains a lot of different tokens used only in the medical industry such as the name of different diseases, devices, organisms, medicines, etc. that makes it difficult for traditional BERT model to create contextualized embedding. In this paper, we are going to illustrate the System for Named Entity Tagging based on Bio-Bert. Experimental results show that our model gives substantial improvements over the baseline and stood the fourth runner up in terms of F1 score, and first runner up in terms of Recall among 13 teams with just 2.21 F1 score behind the best one.

            WordTokenizers.jl is a tool to help users of the Julia programming language work with natural language. WordTokenizers.jl provides a flexible API for defining fast tokenizers and sentence segmentors. Using this API several standard tokenizers and sentence segmenters have been implemented, allowing researchers and practitioners to focus on the higher details of their NLP tasks. WordTokenizers.jl uses a TokenBuffer API and its various lexers for fast word tokenization. TokenBuffer turns the string into a readable stream. A desired set of TokenBuffer lexers are used to read characters from the stream and flush out into an array of tokens. The package provides the following tokenizers made using this API. WordTokenizers.jl is currently being used by packages like TextAnalysis.jl, Transformers.jl and CorpusLoaders.jl for tokenizing text.

          The JuliaText ecosystem provides various packages for working with human languages. In this talk, I showed the usage of these JuliaText packages with Flux.jl for Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a focus on deep learning-based approaches. The attendees will gain working knowledge about how to apply the package for NLP in Julia. The talk will encompass Tokenizers, Word Embeddings, Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformer based Language models.
