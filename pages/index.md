## **About Me**

Hi There! :wave:<br>
I am Ayush Kaushal, a final year undergraduate student, currently majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. 

I am interested in research in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am an open source enthusiast and my avocation includes working on NLP-ML packages.

I am fortunate to be guided by Prof. Humphrey Shi (UOregon) for my ongoing research on Vision+Language tasks. I have previous research experiences at IBM Research India on Detection and Removing Bias in news article text and Google Summer of Code on practical neural models for sequence labelling.

I am pursuing my bachelor thesis under the guidance of Prof. Niloy Ganguly (CNeRG Lab) in the domain of Fairness in ML. My previous research works with them include Explainable Rumour Detection and Stance Detection.
