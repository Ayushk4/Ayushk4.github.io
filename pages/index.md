## **About Me**

<div style="font-size:20px">
Hi There! :wave:
<br><br>
I am an aspiring researcher in the areas of Machine Learning and its applications to Natural Language Processing, Multimodal Learning and Social Computing. I am pursuing my Bachelor Thesis under the guidance of Prof. Niloy Ganguly (CNeRG Lab, IIT Kharagpur) at the intersection of NLP, Deep Learning and Social Computing.
<br><br>
I am currently researching on Multimodal Learning at SHI Labs, University of Oregon. I previously have interned at IBM Research Labs, and Google Summer of Code in the domains of Deep Learning and Natural Language Procesing. Years ago, as a college freshman and sophomore, I developed various open source packages.
