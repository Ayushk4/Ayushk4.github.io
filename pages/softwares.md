From 2018-19 I served as a maintainer for Metakgp's campus centric <a href="https://github.com/metakgp">projects</a>, services, apps and <a href="https://wiki.metakgp.org">institute wiki</a> pages with about 10k+ monthly users. In 2019, I served as the Executive Head for <a href="https://kossiitkgp.org/">Kharagpur Open Source Society</a>, where I taught various workshops on python, git, ubuntu, GoLang. Since 2018, I have also been active with the development of various <a href="https://github.com/JuliaText">packages for NLP</a> in the Julia Language. I currently maintain the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaText/WordTokenizers.jl">WordTokenizers</a> package.

I mentored students in [Google Summer of Code](https://github.com/Ayushk4/Resume/blob/master/certificates/Mentor_GSoC_2020.pdf) 2020, [Google Code-In](https://github.com/Ayushk4/Resume/blob/master/certificates/GCI%202019%20Mentor%20Certificate.pdf), 2019 and [Kharagpur Winter of Code, 2018](https://github.com/Ayushk4/Resume/blob/master/certificates/KWoC18-Ayush%20Kaushal.pdf) programmes with their projects, mini-projects and first Pull-requests respectively.
