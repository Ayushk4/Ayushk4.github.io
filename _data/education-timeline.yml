    - Pursuing Bachelor's Thesis as a part of my undergraduate coursework`:`
    - • <b>Semantics for Stance Detection:</b> Integrated semantics interaction using graph attention over the semantic dependency graph for stance detection. This led to performance at par with the Bert models.
    - • <b>Explainable Tweet Verification:</b> Carried out experiments and implementations for three level explainable approach for tweet verification. Submitted to EMNLP 2020.
    - • <b>Bias in Stance Detection Datasets:</b> Discovered rampant biases in twitter stance datasets and subsequently de-biased them.

    - • Formulated the <b>novel task</b> and created the first system for propaganda identification and removal without information loss in news articles.
    - • Incorporated <b>token-level explainability</b> by token-level propaganda detection and the corresponding de-propagandizing technique used.
    - • Proposed auxiliary tasks of sentiment identification and VAD score for architecture agnostic <b>F1 gains of +3 to +4%</b>.
    - • Devised techniques for lossless propaganda removal, namely classify-delete and style-transfer-rewrite, by thorough study of biastypes.
